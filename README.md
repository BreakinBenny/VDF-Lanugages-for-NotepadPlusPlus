# VDF Lanugages for NotepadPlusPlus
 
This is a set of modified NP++  languages for "Valve Developer Files"<br>
The originals were taken from the Valve Developer Community, but then were altered and expanded to include one more language, and more keywords that were missing.

### Contains Syntax highlighting for the following files:
- DMX (Keyvalues 2 only)
- CFG
- FGD
- NUT (L4D2 Director Vscripts)
- QC
- SMD
- VBSP
- VDF
- VMT

### Also include scripts for the following file types, which must be selected manually
- Talker
- Soundscape
- Soundscript
- Weapon Script
- "Misc" (Not really useful, but it was in the original release, so I re-used it here)
