# VDF Lanugages for NotepadPlusPlus
 
This is a set of modified NP++  languages for "Valve Developer Files"
The originals were taken from the Valve Developer Community, but then were altered and expanded to include one more language, and more keywords that were missing.

### Contains Syntax highlighting for the following files:
- DMX (Keyvalues 2 only)
- CFG
- FGD
- NUT (L4D2 Director Vscripts)
- QC
- SMD
- VBSP
- VDF
- VMT

### Also include scripts for the following file types, which must be selected manually
- Talker
- Soundscape
- Soundscript
- Weapon Script
- "Misc" (Not really useful, but it was in the original release, so I re-used it here)

# Install Instructions
Download this repo and paste all "vdf-******.xml" files in AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\userDefineLangs
*You can get to the "userDefineLangs" folder easily by opening Notepad++, clicking on "Language - User Defined Language - Open User Defined Language folder"*
